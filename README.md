#Welcome to LTEC 647c's Blog Template

This Github repo houses the code base for the oh-so-simple-to-configure blog you can run right here on Github pages for free. If you're an LTEC 647c student, you should consider creating a Github account and forking this repo to create your own blog, or set up your course blog on Wordpress.com. Free software FTW!*

*FTW = for the win

##Setting up your own fork

This repo can be forked to your own Github account, then edited to live at your free Github pages. It's free software (licensed MIT), so let's give the creators some credit:

This blog template was originally developed by Iron Summit Media, and the official Jekyll version of the Clean Blog theme by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/). It was forked and modified to work as the blog template for LTEC 647c by [Billy Meinke](billymeinke.com).

##Before You Begin

In the _config.yml file, the base URL is set to "/ltec-647c-blog-jekyll" which is this themes gh-pages preview. It's recommended that you remove the base URL before working with this theme locally!

It should look like this:
`baseurl: ""`

If you are not making any further changes and are ready for your blog to go live, you will need to change the base URL once more to the name of your repo fork, if you changed it.

It should look like this:
`baseurl: "/my-amazing-blog-name"`

###Why should I use this template?

This template isn't the only way to have your own blog, obviously. What this template is, however, is a lightweight, simple, hackable, mobile-ready blog that's free to use and easy to set up. In the process, you might just learn a thing or two about coding.

## What's Included

This blog template is Jekyll-based, meaning it is made up of static files and no database. Being hosted on Github means that you can edit the files with your browser, or run the blog on your local computer for more editing power. HTML, CSS, and Javascript are the languages of this site.

###Pages

This site comes with the following pages:
* Home - A homepage that displays the most recent 5 posts your the _posts folder of your site (see above example)

* About - A page that you can edit to include information about the blog and about you. It currently has some HTML tips for writing, which you can save for later and delete off the page. This file is called "about.html" and lives in the root folder of this site.

* Contact - A page for listing the ways people can get in touch with you, if you wish. This file is called "contact.html" and lives in the root folder of the site, too.

* Posts - Posts are any files that live in the "_posts" folder of the site and are text files that end with ".html" or ".md". There are 5 sample posts in the folder now, which can be removed and replaced with your own posts as you write them.

You can add new posts online by creating a new file in your _posts folder by following [these Github instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-new-files/).

Take care when naming the file so that it follows the name naming convention as the other posts, and that it is an .html or .md file that has the first few lines of front matter that Jekyll needs to display your posts properly:

A full Jekyll environment is included with this theme. If you have Jekyll installed on your local computer, simply run `jekyll serve` in your command line and preview the build in your browser. You can use `jekyll serve --watch` to watch for changes in the source files as well.

If you need to know more about setting up a Jekyll-based blog on Github pages, there's great information [here](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/), and we'll be going over the basics in class.

## The Course Itself!

There's a course related to this blog, no? Yes!
