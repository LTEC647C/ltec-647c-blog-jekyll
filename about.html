<p>This is where you put a little blurb about yourself, and what this blog is about.</p>

<p>But until you have content you want to include on this page, feel free to check out the HTML formatting tips below.</p>

<h3>HTML styling tips for you</h3>

<p>Below are a few common HTML styling tips that you'll want to use when writing blog posts. HTML is a very simple markup language that works pretty much everywhere on the Web. It's worth your time to become familiar with basic HTML formatting.</p>
<p><i>You can delete this text from the "about.html" file in your site when you're writing up your own About page.</i></p>

<h4>Images</h4>
<p>If you want to insert an image into a page or post, use the following HTML code:</p>
<xmp><img src="/img/kitteh.jpg"></xmp>

<p>It will then be displayed like so:</p>

<img src="/img/kitteh.jpg">

<p>This code tells the browser to find the local file called "kitteh.jpg" in the "/img/" folder of your site, and display it as a image on the page. You can also display images that are hosted somewhere else on the Web by replacing the "/img/kitteh.jpg" with a link to an image somewhere else.</p>

<p>For example, an image you want to put on a page or post is viewable on another website like <b><a href="http://i.imgur.com/SSTWO4Z.jpg">"http://i.imgur.com/SSTWO4Z.jpg"</a>.</b> Go ahead and grab the link (make sure it is a link to an image, not a page!) and use it in the page HTML like this:</p>

<xmp><img src="http://i.imgur.com/SSTWO4Z.jpg"></xmp>

<p>And voila:</p>

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/SSTWO4Z.jpg">

<h4>Bolds, italics, underlines</h4>
<p>You can easily add formatting to your text such as <b>bold</b> lettering, <i>italics</i>, and <u>underlines</u> to emphasize certain parts of your writing.<p>

<p>To make text bold, simply wrap words with code like this:</p>
<xmp><b>bold text!</b></xmp>
<p>The text will then be rendered in your page like this:</p>
<p><b>bold text!</b></p>

<p>Similarly, wrap words with code like this for italics:</p>
<xmp><i>italicized text!</i></xmp>
<p>And it will be rendered like this:</p>
<p><i>italicized text!</i></p>

<p>Lastly, underlines can be used like this:</p>
<xmp><u>Underlined text!</u></xmp>
<p>And it will be rendered like this:</p>
<p><u>Underlined text!</u></p>

<p>Seems simple enough, right? There's lots more you can do, but those are the more common HTML stying codes you'll want for writing blog posts in HTML.</p>
